1. Front End
+ enhance pre-emphasis in boundary condition
+ re-enhance 32-bit MFCC feature extraction

2. DTW based key phrase detection
+ distance metrics
  ++ support 3 types of distance meterics
     a. cosine distance
	 b. Eclidean distance
	 c. Manhattan distance
	[Comments] Preliminary Experiments shows cosine distance has better discriminative ablity than the other two. Need a more comprehensive experiment to prove that.
	           Also KL Divegence is not suitable for distance metrics since our feature vector has negative values, which can not be treated as a pdf of some distribution.

+ cepstrum compression schemes
  ++ support 2 cepstrum compression schemes
     a. log compression, which is a conventional compression type
	 b. cubic root compression, which has better noise reslience by paper from Yahoo lab "Improving the noise-robustness of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for speech recognition"
	This is done to the input of DCT is MFCC calculation

+ DTW transition types
  ++ support 2 DTW transition types
     a. Levenshtein DTW transition, where DELETE pattern is described by [i - 1, j]-->[i, j] in DTW matrix
	 b. typical DTW transition, where DELETE pattern is described by [i - 2, j -1]-->[i, j] in DTW matrix
	[Comments] Preliminary Experiments shows cosine Levenshtein transition has better performance. Need a more comprehensive experiment to prove that.


3. HMM based key phrase detection
   first version of HMM based key phrase detection, by refering to:
   [1] "A Voice Trigger System using Keyword and Speaker Recognition for Mobile Devices"


4. Utility
+add wav file IO interface
+add performance benchmark utility

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Front End
+ add signal scaling into sig_normalize API, input stream will be scaled to the range [-0.5, 0.5]
+ add frame admission API, now only the frame with energy > -30dB compared with max energy will be admitted
+ update default Mel filter bank number from 40 to 26 for better key phrase detection performance

2. GMM
+ refine gmm llr calc procedure, fix scaling error

2. Console Example
+ add gmm test case

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Front End
+ GMM based EVAD work baseline done and merged into code base

2. DTW
+ integrate Vogel Brian's DTW path length calculation algorithm into code base, which
   path length = - 1, if vertical or horizontal path
                |
                 - sqrt( 2 ), if diagonal path
3. GMM
+ add GMM Bayesian Adaptation code, now only mean adaptation is enabled
+ GMM part pass Valgrind memory check test
+ complete input arguments check mechanism

4. HMM
+ HMM part pass Valgrind memory check test

5. Others
+ add Brian's code base into prototype directory
+ add scripts directory for auto benchmark shell scripts
+ add DET benchmark helper functions, which will generate scores which input to NIST DETEval tool
